** Sir this is in case we needed to submit text here as well, I have added the screenshots in the google doc, because it was the only tool I could think off to use on KALI. This text is in a better format on the google doc link I have shared, thanks a lot!!"

Assignment Title: Assignment 1 - Performing a SQL Injection Attack

Course Title: Information Security - Section A

Steps and Commands:

Opening up by virtual box machine and logging in to Kali.


Loading up Firefox and opening up "http://vulnweb.com/".


I selected this website to perform the test: "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/"


Opening the artists page and clicking on the first artist. The page redirects to this URL: "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1"


Changing the URL to "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1'" to check whether we can get access or not.

The page returns this error: "Warning: mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /hj/var/www/artists.php on line 62", this shows website is vulnerable.


After this we open up our Terminal.


First command we write is: "sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 --dbs", this is done to fetch the databases available on the website.

The results we get are: 


In these results we get two table names: acuart and information_schema, for this attack we will be using the table acuart.
Second command which we use is: “sqlmap -u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 -D acuart –tables”, this command is used to fetch the tables in the table ‘acuart’


The results we get are:


We got a total of 8 tables, but for this attack we will use the table ‘users’.
The third command we use is “-u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 -D acuart -T users --columns”, this is used to fetch all the columns in the table ‘users’.




And the results we get are:



We have got 8 columns, but for this attack we will be using 2 of them, “uname” for the Username of the Admin and “address” for the Address of the Admin.
 The fourth command is: “-u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 -D acuart -T users -C uname --dump”.This command is used to fetch the username of the Admin.

The results are: 



Here we can see, the username of the Admin is “test”.




Fifth command is: “-u testphp.vulnweb.com/artists.php?artist=1 -D acuart -T users -C address -dump”, this command is used to fetch the Address of the Admin.


The results are:


Here we can see, the address of the Admin is “21 street”.
